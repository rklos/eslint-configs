# ðŸ§¹ My Personal ESLint Configs for Modern Web Development

Welcome! This repository contains **my own curated ESLint ruleset**, designed for a modern JavaScript/TypeScript stackâ€”including React, Nestjs, TypeScript, testing libraries and accessibility best practices.

> **Note:**  
This config **supports only ESLint 9+** and uses the new [flat config format](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new).  
If you're using an older version of ESLint, you will need to upgrade to use these configs.


## âœ¨ Features

- **My Preferred Rules**: Handpicked and fine-tuned to match my coding style and workflow. Feel free to use it in your own project!
- **Ready for React & TypeScript**: Pre-configured for seamless integration.
- **Accessibility Included**: Sensible defaults for JSX a11y.
- **Based on Airbnb & Community Best Practices**: Enhanced with my personal preferences.

## ðŸš€ Get Started

1. **Install**:  
   `npm install --save-dev rklos/eslint-configs`

2. **Configure**:  
   In your `eslint.config.js` (ESLint 9+ [flat config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new)):
   ```js
   import baseReact from '@rklos/eslint-configs/react';

   export default [
     ...baseReact,
     // You can add your own custom rules or overrides here
   ];
   ```

3. **Enjoy Clean, Consistent Code!**
